## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication

- **NextAuth.js**: The application uses NextAuth.js for secure authentication flows.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage.
- **Session Management**: Sessions are securely managed using JWT and/or database sessions.
- **MFA Support**: Multi-factor authentication is supported for sensitive accounts (admin and provider roles).

### Role-Based Access Control

The application implements a role-based access control (RBAC) system with the following roles:

- **Patient**: Regular users who can access their health records, symptom checker, consultations
- **Provider**: Medical providers who can conduct consultations and view assigned patient records
- **Admin**: Administrative users with system configuration capabilities

Each API endpoint and page implements proper authorization checks using the `validateSession` utility function.

## Data Protection

### Data Encryption

- **Data in Transit**: All data is transmitted over HTTPS.
- **Sensitive Data**: Personal health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII) are encrypted at rest.
- **Database Security**: MongoDB connection uses TLS and authentication.

### Data Minimization

- The application collects only necessary information for providing healthcare services.
- Data retention policies limit how long sensitive information is stored.

## API Security

### Input Validation

- All API inputs are validated using Zod schemas before processing.
- Validation prevents injection attacks and ensures data quality.

### Error Handling

- Custom error handling prevents leaking sensitive information.
- Structured error responses maintain security while providing useful information.

### Rate Limiting

- Rate limiting is implemented on sensitive endpoints to prevent abuse.
- Authentication endpoints have stricter rate limits to prevent brute force attacks.

## Compliance Considerations

### HIPAA Compliance

For US deployments, the following HIPAA considerations are implemented:

- **Access Controls**: Strict role-based access with audit trails.
- **Encryption**: PHI is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- **Business Associate Agreements**: Required for third-party services handling PHI.
- **Breach Notification**: Procedures for identifying and reporting security incidents.

### GDPR Compliance

For EU deployments, the following GDPR features are implemented:

- **Consent Management**: Clear consent collection for data processing.
- **Data Subject Rights**: Functionality for users to access, rectify, and delete their data.
- **Data Portability**: Export functionality for user data.
- **Privacy by Design**: Data protection considerations throughout the application architecture.

## Security Monitoring

### Logging

- Security-relevant events are logged with appropriate detail.
- Log storage follows secure practices to prevent tampering.
- PII/PHI is redacted from logs where possible.

### Audit Trails

- All actions on patient data are recorded in audit logs.
- Administrator actions are comprehensively logged.
- Logs include timestamp, user, action, and affected resource.

## Incident Response

### Detection

- Monitoring systems detect unusual activity patterns.
- Alerts are configured for potential security events.

### Response Plan

1. **Identification**: Security events are promptly identified and categorized.
2. **Containment**: Immediate actions to limit impact of security incidents.
3. **Eradication**: Remove the cause of the incident.
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation.
5. **Learning**: Post-incident analysis to improve security posture.

### Reporting

- Clear processes for internal escalation of security incidents.
- Procedures for notifying affected users when required.
- Documentation of incidents and response actions.

## Implementation Best Practices

### Secure Coding Guidelines

- Input validation on all user-provided data
- Output encoding to prevent XSS attacks
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Proper error handling to avoid information disclosure

### Dependency Management

- Regular security scanning of dependencies
- Prompt updates for security patches
- Minimizing dependency scope and permissions
