# üöÄ AI-HealthCare Deployment Guide

This document provides detailed instructions for deploying the AI-HealthCare platform to various environments.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before deploying, make sure you have:

1. **MongoDB Database** - Either MongoDB Atlas (recommended for production) or a self-hosted MongoDB instance
2. **OpenAI API Key** - For the AI-powered symptom checker
3. **Twilio Account** (optional) - For SMS functionality
4. **Environment Variables** - All required environment variables as described below

## üîß Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# üóÑÔ∏è Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/ai-healthcare?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# üîê Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-production-url.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secure-secret-key
# For production, generate a secure secret with: openssl rand -base64 32

# ü§ñ AI Services
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# üì± SMS Services (Optional - Twilio)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-twilio-account-sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-twilio-auth-token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your-twilio-phone-number

# üåê Public Base URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-production-url.com
```

## üîÑ Local Deployment

To run the application locally:

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

Vercel is the recommended platform for deploying Next.js applications:

1. **Create a Vercel account** at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)

2. **Install Vercel CLI** (optional)
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

3. **Deploy from the command line** (if using Vercel CLI)
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

   Or connect your GitHub repository in the Vercel dashboard for automatic deployments.

4. **Configure environment variables** in the Vercel dashboard under Project Settings > Environment Variables.

   Recommended variables (copy from `.env.example`):

   | Name | Environment | Example |
   |------|-------------|---------|
   | MONGODB_URI | All | mongodb+srv://... |
   | NEXTAUTH_URL | Production | https://your-domain.com |
   | NEXTAUTH_URL | Preview | https://\${VERCEL_URL} |
   | NEXTAUTH_SECRET | All | use a secure random string |
   | OPENAI_API_KEY | All | sk-... |
   | TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID | All/Optional | AC... |
   | TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN | All/Optional | ... |
   | TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER | All/Optional | +1... |
   | NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL | Production | https://your-domain.com |

   Notes:
   - Set NEXTAUTH_URL per environment (Production: your domain, Preview: https://\${VERCEL_URL})
   - Ensure MONGODB_URI allows connections from Vercel IPs (Atlas allows all by default if 0.0.0.0/0)

5. **Set up MongoDB integration** in the Vercel dashboard.

6. **Configure deployment settings**
   - Node.js: 18.x or higher
   - Enable Edge/Serverless default (no custom server needed)
   - Add your custom domain(s) and set primary domain

7. **Set up preview deployments** (optional)
   - In your Vercel project settings, configure preview deployments for branches
   - This allows testing changes before merging to production

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

You can also deploy using Docker:

1. **Create a Dockerfile** in the project root:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:18-alpine AS base
   
   # Install dependencies only when needed
   FROM base AS deps
   WORKDIR /app
   
   # Copy package files
   COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./
   
   # Install dependencies
   RUN npm ci
   
   # Build the application
   FROM base AS builder
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
   COPY . .
   
   # Set environment variables
   ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1
   
   # Build application
   RUN npm run build
   
   # Production image, copy all the files and run next
   FROM base AS runner
   WORKDIR /app
   
   ENV NODE_ENV production
   ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1
   
   # Create a non-root user
   RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
   RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs
   
   # Set the correct permissions
   COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
   COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./
   COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static
   
   USER nextjs
   
   EXPOSE 3000
   
   ENV PORT 3000
   
   CMD ["node", "server.js"]
   ```

2. **Create a docker-compose.yml file** for easier deployment:
   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   
   services:
     app:
       build:
         context: .
         dockerfile: Dockerfile
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       env_file:
         - .env.local
       restart: always
       healthcheck:
         test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/api/health"]
         interval: 30s
         timeout: 10s
         retries: 3
   ```

3. **Build and run** the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## üå©Ô∏è AWS Deployment
